This directory contains the Binary search tree class 'BST.h' and the two main() functions 'Test.cpp' for testing the functionality and 'performance.cpp' for carrying out a performance test on the key lookup. These files are modified in order to allow a 'Doxygen' documentation. The html-link to get insight into the framework and rational of the BST class is: file:///D:/PhD%20course%20SISSA-Physics%20and%20Chemistry%20of%20Biological%20Systems/Modules/Advanced%20Programming/Exam/C++/Class/Doxygen/Documentation/html/index.html. Additionally in the directory 'Documentation' a 'Documentation.pdf' can be found along side the 'Doxyfile' which was used for creating the html and latex 'Doxygen' documentation.
