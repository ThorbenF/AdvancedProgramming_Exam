A Binary Search Tree (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_b_s_t}{B\+ST}}) class was developed. A \mbox{\hyperlink{class_b_s_t}{B\+ST}} is a node-\/based ordered data structure. Left subtrees of a node contain only nodes with keys lesser and right subtrees only contain nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. The left and right subtree are also B\+S\+Ts. The framework offers storing pairs of key and value, iterating from smallest to largest key through nodes, balancing the tree such that lookup complexity reduces to approximately Olog(\+N), finding the value of a given key, copy and move semantic as well as printing the tree traversed in ascending order. \hypertarget{index_Files}{}\doxysubsection{Files}\label{index_Files}
The documented files are the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_b_s_t}{B\+ST}} class \textquotesingle{}\mbox{\hyperlink{_b_s_t_8h}{B\+S\+T.\+h}}\textquotesingle{} containing the entire functionality, the \textquotesingle{}\mbox{\hyperlink{_test_8cpp}{Test.\+cpp}}\textquotesingle{} being the main method for demonstration purposes and the \textquotesingle{}\mbox{\hyperlink{_performance_8cpp}{Performance.\+cpp}}\textquotesingle{} is the method needed for the performance run regarding average lookup times.
