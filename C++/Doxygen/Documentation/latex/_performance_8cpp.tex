\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The file contains a procedure to investigate the performance of the lookup in unbalanced and balanced \mbox{\hyperlink{class_b_s_t}{B\+S\+T()}} via member function find() compared to std\+::map. Average lookup-\/times are measured using std\+::chrono\+::high\+\_\+resolution\+\_\+clock and normalised with respect to the number of nodes present. The performance is tested for node numbers in the range of 10000 to 10000000. The output is a Average\+Lookup\+Times.\+txt which is containing lookup-\/times in nanoseconds in the format \textquotesingle{}std\+::map \+: \mbox{\hyperlink{class_b_s_t}{B\+S\+T(unbalanced)}} \+: \mbox{\hyperlink{class_b_s_t}{B\+S\+T(balanced)}}\textquotesingle{}.

Vector to store the lookup-\/times is constructed. And the node range is defined.

Vector for keys is constructed and contains keys in the node range.

Vector for input keys is constructed and contains the keys, but in a random order.

Vector for lookup keys is constructed and contains the keys, but in randomised lookup order.

A std\+::map is populated with the input keys.

The time to lookup all keys in the randomised lookup order is measured in nanoseconds.

Average lookup-\/times are stored.

A \mbox{\hyperlink{class_b_s_t}{B\+S\+T()}} is populated with the input keys.

The time to lookup all keys in the randomised lookup order is measured in nanoseconds.

Average lookup-\/times are stored.

The unbalanced \mbox{\hyperlink{class_b_s_t}{B\+S\+T()}} is copied and balanced afterwards.

The time to lookup all keys in the randomised lookup order is measured in nanoseconds.

Average lookup-\/times are stored.

The output-\/file is generated.
