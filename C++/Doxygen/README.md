# BST documentation

This directory contains the Binary search tree class 'BST.h' and the two main() functions 'Test.cpp' for testing the functionality and 'performance.cpp' for carrying out a performance test on the key lookup. These files are modified in order to allow a 'Doxygen' documentation. The html-link to get insight into the framework and rational of the BST class can be found at 'Documentation/html/index.html'  
Additionally in the directory 'Documentation' a 'Documentation.pdf' can be found along side the 'Doxyfile' which was used for creating the html and latex 'Doxygen' documentation.
