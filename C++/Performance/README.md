# Investigating lookup performance

Compiling can be achieved with 'make'.  
Running the executable 'performance' will take approx. 10 h on your local machine and then a file similar to 'AverageLookupTimes.txt' in content will be generated.  
To produce a plot like 'lookup_times_linear_scale.png' the script 'plot_performance.py' can be run using python3.  
For documentation please check directory 'C++/Doxygen'.
